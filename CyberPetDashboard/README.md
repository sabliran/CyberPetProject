# CyberPet Dashboard

A Docker-hosted web control panel for the CyberPet habit-tracking device.
Add/remove habits and goals, tweak settings, and watch your pet's synced
state — all from a browser on your local network.

## Run it

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open `http://localhost:8090` (or `http://<your-machine's-LAN-IP>:8090`
from another device, e.g. your phone).

Data persists in a Docker volume (`cyberpet-data`), so habits/goals/settings
survive container restarts. To reset everything, remove the volume:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Without docker-compose

```bash
docker build -t cyberpet-dashboard .
docker run -d -p 8090:8080 -v cyberpet-data:/app/data --name cyberpet-dashboard cyberpet-dashboard
```

## Connecting the device

1. Find the LAN IP of the machine running this container (not `localhost` —
   the ESP32 needs a real IP on your network, e.g. `192.168.1.50`).
2. In `CyberPet.ino` (the firmware project), set:
   ```cpp
   const char* WIFI_SSID = "YourNetwork";
   const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "YourPassword";
   const char* DASHBOARD_URL = "http://192.168.1.50:8090";
   ```
3. Install **ArduinoJson v7+** (by Benoit Blanchon) via Arduino IDE's
   Library Manager — `wifi_sync.cpp` depends on it (`JsonDocument` syntax).
4. Reflash. On boot the device will connect to WiFi and start syncing every
   60 seconds (adjustable via `SYNC_INTERVAL_MS` in the sketch, or from the
   dashboard's Settings panel once synced state is wired up further).

If `WIFI_SSID` is left blank, the device just runs standalone with no
network calls — the dashboard becomes optional, not required.

## Storage

Data lives in `better-sqlite3` (synchronous SQLite). The database file is at
`/app/data/store.db` inside the container — persisted in the `cyberpet-data`
Docker volume. Schema:

| Table | Contents |
|---|---|
| `habits` | habit definitions (id, name, xpValue, active) |
| `goals` | goal definitions (id, name, xpValue, period, active) |
| `quests` | quest definitions (id, name, xpValue, description, done, done_at, active) |
| `todos` | todo items (id, text, done, category) |
| `completion_log` | every habit check-off with date + timestamp (indexed by date) |
| `kv` | JSON-encoded scalars: petState, settings, counters, dashXpTotal |

On first run, if a legacy `store.json` exists in `/app/data/`, it is
automatically migrated and renamed to `store.json.migrated`. The Dockerfile
uses a multi-stage build so native `better-sqlite3` binaries are compiled
against Alpine's musl libc inside the builder container, not copied from the
host.

## Fixed in the v6 revision

- **Dashboard settings weren't consumed by the firmware** — `moodGainPerHabit`,
  `moodDecayPerMiss`, and `dailyResetHour` existed in the API but `pet.cpp`
  hardcoded mood gain (2) and decay (15). Fixed by adding a `PetSettings`
  struct to the hardware-agnostic layer (`pet.h`), consuming all three fields
  from the `/api/sync` response via `pet.applySettings()` (validates ranges —
  0-100 for mood fields, 0-23 for hour). Settings are persisted to NVS so a
  standalone boot after a previous sync keeps the last-configured values.
  `WifiSync` no longer carries a `dailyResetHour` field; `loop()` reads it
  from `pet.getSettings().dailyResetHour`.

## Fixed in the v5 revision

- **Renaming a habit on the dashboard wiped its on-device streak** — the
  device now carries `Habit::serverId` (the dashboard's `habit.id`) and
  reconciles by id first; the name is updated in place on a match, so renames
  are transparent to streak/completion state. The sync endpoint now also
  accepts `completedHabits` as `[{id, name}, ...]` objects (firmware sends
  the server id alongside the name), which lets the server resolve the current
  name even for habits renamed since the last sync. Legacy string-name arrays
  from older firmware still work.
- `/api/sync` API reference: `completedHabits` updated from `[names]` to
  `[{id, name}]` (id = dashboard `habit.id`, -1 if unsynced).

## Fixed in the v4 revision

- **SQLite backend** — replaced the single-JSON-file store (`store.js`) with
  `better-sqlite3`. Same `get()`/`update()` API, zero changes to server
  routes. Gains: proper relational schema, indexed `completion_log` for future
  analytics, WAL journal mode, auto-migration from `store.json`.
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile** — builder stage compiles native addons with
  `python3`/`make`/`g++`; runtime stage copies only the finished binary.
  `.dockerignore` excludes `backend/node_modules` so local binaries never
  pollute the Alpine container.

## Fixed in the v3 revision

- **Dashboard XP was silently discarded by the device** — XP awarded via quests
  or manual habit completions was written into `petState` on the dashboard, but
  the device overwrote `petState` on every sync so the XP vanished within one
  cycle. Fixed with a monotonic `dashXpTotal` counter: the dashboard accumulates
  all awarded XP; the device applies only the delta above what it has already
  received (`applyDashboardXpTotal` in `pet.cpp`) — idempotent, no ack needed.
  Quest completions also bump `configVersion` so the device's 5 s config poll
  delivers the XP promptly.
- **Long habit names produced null completions and zero streaks** — `recordCompletions`
  and `streakFor` used strict `===` matching against names that may have been
  truncated to 23 chars on-device. Replaced with `namesMatch()`, a
  truncation-aware helper consistent with the firmware's `strncmp` rule.
- **Sync response overflow killed sync silently** — the ArduinoJson response
  buffer was `StaticJsonDocument<2048>`; a response including habits + goals +
  quests + settings easily exceeds that, causing `deserializeJson` to fail and
  the device to stop syncing. Replaced with `DynamicJsonDocument(6144)`.
- **docker run port** — `README.md` listed `-p 8080:8080` (host 8080 is taken by
  SearXNG); corrected to `-p 8090:8080`.

## Fixed in the v2 revision

- Device sync now sends habit **names** as completions (`completedHabits`)
  instead of internal slot indices; the server accepts both for
  compatibility.
- `/api/settings` now whitelists known keys and drops null/empty/NaN
  values, so a half-filled dashboard form can't wipe out valid settings.
  The frontend also strips empty fields before sending.
- Firmware-side name comparison is now truncation-aware, fixing a bug
  where habits with names >23 chars were removed and re-added (streak
  wiped) on every single sync.

## Known gaps / next steps

- **Goals aren't synced to the device yet** — the API and dashboard UI for
  goals are complete, but `wifi_sync.cpp` only pulls/pushes habits and pet
  state right now.
- **Completion history** — ✅ DONE. Each `/api/sync` call appends dated
  records `{habitId, habitName, xpValue, date, deviceId, completedAt}` to the
  `completion_log` table via `store.appendCompletions()`. Deduped per habit per
  day, capped at 365 days. The Overview tab surfaces a GitHub-style heatmap
  (4/12/16-week range buttons) and per-habit current/best streak with a
  14-day dot display. Endpoints: `GET /api/history?days=N` and
  `GET /api/history/streaks`.
- **No auth** — designed for a trusted local network (your home WiFi).
  Don't expose port 8090 (host side) to the public internet without adding
  authentication first.
- **Settings are now fully consumed by the firmware** — `moodGainPerHabit`,
  `moodDecayPerMiss`, and `dailyResetHour` from `/api/settings` are applied
  via `pet.applySettings()` on every sync and persisted to NVS so standalone
  reboots keep the last-configured values.
